headtrackr
==========

**headtrackr** is a javascript library for real-time *face tracking* and *head tracking*, tracking the position of a users head in relation to the computer screen, via a web camera and the [webRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)/[getUserMedia](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html) standard.

For a demonstration see [this video](https://vimeo.com/44049736) or try out some of the examples with a laptop that has a camera and a browser that has camera webRTC/getUserMedia support (for instance [Opera 12](http://www.opera.com/browser/)). For an overview of browsers supporting the getUserMedia standard see [http://caniuse.com/stream](http://caniuse.com/stream).
